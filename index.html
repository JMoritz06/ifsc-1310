  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
  <h3>What it means to me</h3>
    <p>Web accessibilty is basically having things online like web pages that are understanding and involving all groups of people. This includes people with disabilities like if they are deaf or blind.</p>
  <h3>Importance</h3>
  Web accessibilty is very important for the web because people should not be involved or discriminated against because of a disability. It is crucial that sites also include things like a screen reader for an article or captions for a video. The web is meant for all people so it should also be designed for all people.
