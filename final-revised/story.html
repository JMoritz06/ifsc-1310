             The Aurora attempts to perform a slingshot maneuver in the atmosphere of Planet 4546B with 157 people aboard to begin the construction of a new phase gate in the Ariadne Arm. A weird signal is detected coming from Planet 4546B and a moment later the Aurora is hit with some kind of energy weapon. The ship loses control and starts decending into the atmosphere of Planet 4556B causing its crew to initiate evacuation. 29 to 44 people manage to eject in Lifepods 1-25, but only ten manage to make it to the surface. You are one of those 10.

             While you explore this new oceanic planet there are some mysteries beginning to pile up. Strange structures are seen built onto islands or deep into caves that were definitly made by some sort of beings stated to be "precursers". Exploring brings more questions than answers. There even seems to be some sort of infection spreading from creature to creature. The only way forward is to survive especially with no help in sight for a long time.

             One thing for sure is that the wildlife is extraordinarily different. They have adapted to the water based environment and made the best with what they have. So you will have to do the same to be successfull But something is off. Something talked to you asking "what... are... you?". While staying on the surface is safe, the only way to get answers and maybe even find a safe way off the planet is to head deeper.
