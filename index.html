  <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
  <p>Web accessibility is very important as the internet/web grows. To me it is basically how available the web is to all parties. This includes all ages, genders, disabled persons being able to access the same pages and resources. It is very crucial to question web accessibility when creating a web page because that is the point of the web. To have anyone able to access the resources that they may need. Whether that is including code for a screen reader or having the layout simple for easy understanding. For web developement to grow web accessibility must be put on the top of the priority list. </p>

  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is the web developement strategy of starting with the content and then building up. Basically starting with structered html and then inputting the content. Then after all content is added moving on to presentation like css and features like javascript. This startegy is really important for the future of web development for a few reasons. With modern technology there are so many different ways of accessign the web like through a phone or computer. It is important to allow access from all devices to advocate for anyone to vist a site. So building from the content first allows anyone to be able to access said content instead of being limited by their technology or even their browser. Progessive enhancement kind of ties to web accessibility as it allows for the developers to have an easier time allowing different windows versions or old browsers have access to their site. It really differs from graceful degradation which starts at a high and focuses on accessibility last. Progressive enhancement is a positive strategy and should be used extensively. </p>

  <h2>Final Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>This semester has been a fun and interesting expierence for me. I have never really enjoyed coding until this class. I feel that over time I definitly improved a lot with things like laying out a basic html structure for a site. But other things still sometimes get me like the different character to use when selecting a class vs. an id in css. Overall I still learned a lot and tried to replicate that in my final project. 

  When starting my final it was nice to be able to choose my own type of site from something I enjoy like video games. So I made an information website about a game. For the version 1 of the final I think I did an ok job but had a lot to improve on. For feedback I asked my father to take a look and give me what he thought about it. Overall, he said he liked it except for the main home page. He said it just needed something more. So I then went on to my Revised version. I added some more text to the other pages fixed some names and errors. For the home page I decided adding a few images of the gameplay would fit perfectly. So I used the structure of the java slideshow demo to fix jump on that feedback from my father. Overall this project was fun to go over everything I learned this semester and also test my ability to put it into practice.
